# Final Project -- UFC Match Outcome Predictor

### Outline

#### Communication Protocols
Team has established a communication line through a team slack channel.  Group meetings will occur through zoom weekly, one hour before TA office hours ( 06:00PM Friday, 11:00AM Saturday & Sunday), in addition to designated class hours on Tuesday and Thursday.

When making commits to the main branch team members are responsible for communicating with the team through the slack channel what they are commiting and whether there are any connections being made to established working code.  If there are connections being made to existing code, the team member attempting to add code is responsible for reaching another team member to double check work, preferably the team member who had added the established code, to ensure there are no conflicts.

#### Roles & Expectations
Roles have been randomly assigned and are listed below:

|               | **Week 1**     | **Week 2**  | **Week 3** | **Week 4**  |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------|----------- |------------ |
| **Repository**|Andrew Gregorash| ----------  |            |             |
| **ML Model**  | Mattie Jordan  |             |            |             |
| **Database**  | Priti Islam    |             |            |             |
| **Technology**| Cesar Ozuna    |             |            |             |

Each member is expected to complete their assigned work to the 'Mastery' standard for each section of the project, outlined in the rubric and found in the [Guidelines](https://github.com/agregorash/final_project/blob/main/Guidelines/Module%2B20%2B-Project%2BRubrics%2B-%2BSegment%2B1.pdf) folder of this repository.

Once a member has finished their work for each section they are expected to reach out to the other team members and offer to help, as workloads will vary section to section, ensuring that everyone is contributing equally.
