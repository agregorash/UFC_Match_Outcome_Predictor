# Final Project -- UFC Match Outcome Predictor

## Overview

We will be analyzing UFC fight data. 

UFC enthusiasts typically use bets and odds to favour who will win a fight. We thought would be interesting to use data and fighter statistics to create an educated prediction on who will win the fight. 

### Questions we hope to answer with data:

**1. Q1**

**2. Q2**

**3. Q3**

**4. Q4**

**5. Q5**

### Resources

Through a Kaggle search we identified a robust dataset with 4,567 fight records dating from 3/21/2010- 2/6/2021. 

**- Data Sources:** [most-recent-event.csv](https://github.com/agregorash/final_project/blob/main/Resources/most-recent-event.csv), [resources-master.csv](https://github.com/agregorash/final_project/blob/main/Resources/ufc-master.csv), [upcoming-event.csv](https://github.com/agregorash/final_project/blob/main/Resources/upcoming-event.csv)

**- Technologies Used:**
- Data Cleaning and Analysis: Pandas to be used for data scrubbing and for the purpose of performing exploratory data analysis.
- Database Storage: We will be using PgAdmin to manage PostgresSQL will integrate D3, HTML & JSS to display the data.
- Machine Learning: We will be using numpy and pandas data wrangling libraries along with seaborn & Scikit-Learn for machine learning libraries. Our training and testing setup is train test split sklearn.
- Dashboard: In addition to using HTML & JSS, we will also integrate D3.js to display a visual dashboard. It will be hosted on PostgresSQL.

### Communication Protocols

Team has established a communication line through a team slack channel.  Group meetings will occur through zoom weekly, one hour before TA office hours ( 06:00PM Friday, 11:00AM Saturday & Sunday), in addition to designated class hours on Tuesday and Thursday.
When making commits to the main branch team members are responsible for communicating with the team through the slack channel what they are commiting and whether there are any connections being made to established working code.  If there are connections being made to existing code, the team member attempting to add code is responsible for reaching another team member to double check work, preferably the team member who had added the established code, to ensure there are no conflicts.

#### Roles & Expectations

Roles have been randomly assigned and are listed below:

Each member is expected to complete their assigned work to the 'Mastery' standard for each section of the project, outlined in the rubric and found in the [Guidelines](https://github.com/agregorash/final_project/blob/main/Guidelines/Module%2B20%2B-Project%2BRubrics%2B-%2BSegment%2B1.pdf) folder of this repository.

Once a member has finished their work for each section they are expected to reach out to the other team members and offer to help, as workloads will vary section to section, ensuring that everyone is contributing equally.
